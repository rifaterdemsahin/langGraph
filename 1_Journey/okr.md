- **KR 1.2:** Implement persistent vector database integration (Chroma/Weaviate) replacing in-memory storage (Target: Handle 1000+ documents)
- **KR 1.3:** Deploy graph database (Neo4j) for link relationship management with < 100ms query response time
- **KR 1.4:** Create automated ingestion pipeline capable of processing 1000 new files daily

### 🧠 Objective 2: Master LangGraph Architecture Patterns
*Develop deep understanding of stateful workflow orchestration*

**Key Results:**
- **KR 2.1:** Document and implement 5+ distinct LangGraph node patterns (semantic retrieval, graph traversal, answer generation, etc.)
- **KR 2.2:** Create reusable workflow templates for common RAG scenarios (Target: 3 templates)
- **KR 2.3:** Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all graph nodes and state transitions
- **KR 2.4:** Build comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for each workflow step

### 🔧 Objective 3: Establish Robust Development Environment
*Create reproducible, scalable development and testing infrastructure*

**Key Results:**
- **KR 3.1:** Set up automated testing pipeline with CI/CD integration (Target: <5min build time)

# 6_Symbols — Code & Implementation 💻

Concrete code snippets, runnable examples, and implementation notes that bring the concepts to life.

Purpose
- Demonstrate practical implementations that map to concepts and guides elsewhere in the structure.

What you'll find
- Minimal, well-documented code examples for each concept.
- A `scripts/` folder for small CLI helpers used in the learning flow.

How to use
- Run examples locally, inspect comments, and adapt them to your use case. Link back to `4_UI` and `5_Formula` for theory.

CLI install
- The install script will create `6_Symbols/scripts/` and place helper scripts (make executable). Use:

  bash create_learning_structure.sh

Rendering images
- Add architecture screenshots to `assets/6_symbols/` and reference in code docs.

Learning verb: Execute it — Practice by reading and running code.

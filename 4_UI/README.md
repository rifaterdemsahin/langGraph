# 4_UI — Learning & Concepts 🧠

Catalog of concepts, theories, and core skills to master while moving through the roadmap.

Purpose
- Centralize learning materials, explanations, and short concept notes.

What you'll find
- Concept cards (definition, short example, links to deeper reading).
- Visual aids and micro-challenges to practice each concept.

How to use
- Read concept cards, try the micro-challenges, then implement a small example in `6_Symbols`.

CLI install
- Folder automatically created by the install script. Add images to `assets/4_ui/` for visual concept cards.

Rendering images
- Use small illustrative PNG/SVG files referenced from `assets/4_ui/` so images render in docs.

Learning verb: Imagine it — Build mental models and small experiments.
